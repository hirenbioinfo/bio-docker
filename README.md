# Bioinformatics with Docker

Welcome to my biodocker folder! Here, I share my work related to bioinformatics and Docker, focusing on containerizing bioinformatics tools and pipelines for easier deployment and reproducibility.

## Contents

- **Dockerized Tools**: Dockerfiles and Docker images of bioinformatics tools I have developed or find useful. Each tool is contained within a separate directory, accompanied by documentation and instructions on how to use it.

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step tutorials and guides on using Docker in bioinformatics workflows. These tutorials cover various topics, including setting up Docker, running bioinformatics analyses using Docker containers, and optimizing performance.

- **Projects**: Case studies and projects showcasing the application of Docker in bioinformatics. These projects highlight real-life examples where Docker containerization has enhanced reproducibility, scalability, and collaboration in bioinformatics research.


Feel free to explore the content in this folder and engage in discussions. I'm always open to collaboration and exchanging ideas with fellow bioinformatics and Docker enthusiasts.

If you find any of the content helpful, don't hesitate to reach out or give it a star. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated.

Let's advance bioinformatics through the power of Docker!
